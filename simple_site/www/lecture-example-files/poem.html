The world is a beautiful place
                                        -- Lawrence Ferlinghetti




                The world is a beautiful place
                                                                to be born into
if you don't mind happiness
                                                   not always being
                                                                                 so very much fun
       if you don't mind a touch of hell
                                                             now and then
                 just when everything is fine
                                                                   because even in heaven
                                  they don't sing
                                                           all the time

                 The world is a beautiful place
                                                                     to be born into
      if you don't mind some people dying
                                                                         all the time
                            or maybe only starving
                                                                    some of the time
                   which isn't half so bad
                                                             if it isn't you
        <!-- formatted up to here -->
     Oh the world is a beautiful place
                                                         to be born into
               if you don't much mind
                                                    a few dead minds
                            in the higher places
                                                           or a bomb or two
                                  now and then
                                                       in your upturned faces
                or such other improprieties
                                                          as our Name Brand society
                                          is prey to
                                                        with its men of distinction
                      and its men of extinction
                                                            and its priests
                                  and other patrolmen
                                                                  and its various segregations
                  and congressional investigations
                                                                      and other constipations
                                that our fool flesh
                                                               is heir to


   Yes the world is the best place of all
                                                             for a lot of such things as
         making the fun scene
                                              and making the love scene
and making the sad scene
                                     and singing low songs and having inspirations
     and walking around
                                    looking at everything
                                                                     and smelling flowers
     and goosing statues
                                    and even thinking
                                                                and kissing people and
          making babies and wearing pants
                                                             and waving hats and
                                         dancing
                                                    and going swimming in rivers
                               on picnics
                                       in the middle of the summer
            and just generally
                                         'living it up'

    Yes
      but then right in the middle of it
                                                       comes the smiling

                                           mortician
