Episode IV

A New Hope

It is a period of civil war.
Rebel spaceships, striking
from a hidden base, have
won their first victory
against the evil Galactic
Empire.

During the battle, rebel
spies managed to steal
secret plans to the Empire's
ultimate weapon, the
Death Star, an armored
space station with enough
power to destroy an entire
planet.
